        <p>Apple has released iOS 26, bringing a major visual overhaul with the new Liquid Glass design language, enhanced AI-powered features through Apple Intelligence, and significant improvements to core apps.
          The update is now available as a free download for all compatible devices.

          Liquid Glass Design: A new, translucent interface with fluid animations and dynamic effects, including a depth-enhanced lock screen clock and 3D spatial scenes generated from photos.
          Apple Intelligence & Siri: Siri now offers product knowledge with device and context awareness, and Apple Intelligence powers features like call screening, live translation, and task suggestions based on emails and text.
          Call Screening & Hold Assist: The Phone app can now auto-screen calls from unknown numbers, requiring callers to state their reason before connecting, and Hold Assist notifies users when a live agent answers during a hold.
          Live Translation: Real-time translation is available in Phone, FaceTime, and Messages for calls and texts in multiple languages, working on-device and with AirPods Pro 2/3 and AirPods 4 with ANC.
          Visual Intelligence: The ability to take a screenshot and receive context-aware suggestions, such as adding an event to the calendar or searching for an item on the screen, is now available.
          New Apps & Features: The Apple Games app offers a centralized hub for gaming, the Photos app has returned to its Library and Collections tabs, and the Camera app has a simplified layout with a lens cleaning indicator.
          Other Notable Updates: Enhanced messaging with typing indicators and polls, new emoji combination features (Genmoji), improved Maps with route learning and visited places, and new AirPods Pro 3 features like heart rate monitoring.</p>
